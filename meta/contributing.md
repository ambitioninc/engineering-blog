Jekyll
------
This site is built with Jekyll. If you need a primer, check out [this one](https://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example/tutorial)

Two handy commands to know are 
* `jekyll serve --watch`
* `jekyll build --watch`

If you run two tabs with each of these running in the blog's directory, you can easily see the changes by going to http://localhost:4000

Posts
-----
Posts can be added to the `_posts` directory and should have the format `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md`.


Frontmatter
-----------
The Frontmatter in Jekyll is a header to your markdown file specifying a few configuration options.
```
